		<p>I am currently an undergraduate student of The University of the West Indies pursuing a BSc in Computer Science. While I am a competent computer scientist in training, my true passion resides in the field of Fine Arts, both visual arts, and practical sculptures. I do traditional realism portraits and still life pieces, as well as graphic designs and illustrations. I am more popularly known for headphones that I make (from coconut shells and wood) personally tailored to the customer. My ultimate aim is to work as a computer scientist for a well-paying organization in order to fund my creative aspirations, and one day have my own arts studio or headphone company. Or both.</p>
